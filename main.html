    <h1>The Beagle blog</h1>

    <p>The beagle is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound. The beagle was developed
    primarily for hunting hare, known as beagling. Possessing a great sense of smell and superior tracking instincts, the
    beagle is the primary breed used as a detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine
    around the world. The beagle is intelligent and is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited
    health problems.
    
    The modern breed was developed in Great Britain around the 1830s from several breeds, including the Talbot Hound, the
    North Country Beagle, the Southern Hound, and possibly the Harrier.
    
    Beagles have been depicted in popular culture since Elizabethan times in literature and paintings and more recently in
    film, television, and comic books.</p>
